"""
The classic game of Connect Four is played by two players in a grid of 6 row_count
by 7 column_count, standing vertically. Players alternately drop one token from
the top of one column, and the token falls to the lowest possible grid cell,
stacking up on the tokens below it. The first player to make a horizontal,
vertical or diagonal line of 4 tokens wins the game.

From the description of one game grid, your program must determine in which
column_count each player may complete a line if they play first on the next turn.
